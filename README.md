# CS486---Final-Project
1. I used Unity 2018.1.0f2(64bits) to build the game.
2. You need to import Unity Affectiva SDK in the asset. 
3. The scene in the game is called "level", you can find it from the Scenes folder. 
4. After you import Affectiva SDK, add component Detector, Camera Input in the main camera.
5. Now you should be able to run the game.
